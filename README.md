# Insurance-data-analysis

In this repository, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of an insurance dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends. The dataset comprises the following columns: age, sex, BMI, gender, number of children, charges, and smoking status. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced analytical techniques, I have uncovered valuable information that sheds light on various aspects of insurance-related patterns.

and i have also predicted the medical charge with 86.4% accuracy using GradientBoostingRegressor algorithm 

Key Findings:

Age and Charges Relationship: A detailed examination of age and charges reveals how insurance costs vary across different age groups. Insights into the impact of age on insurance charges can help in segmenting pricing strategies effectively.

Gender and Charges Disparity: By analyzing charges based on gender, I have identified potential gender-based disparities in insurance costs, which could be valuable for ensuring fair pricing.

BMI and Health Costs: The relationship between BMI and charges underscores the influence of health status on insurance expenses. These insights could contribute to personalized health and wellness programs.

Smoking Impact: Analysis of smoking status highlights the substantial cost difference between smokers and non-smokers, offering insights into risk assessment and policy design.

Family Considerations: Exploring the effects of the number of children on insurance charges provides valuable information for families and could lead to tailored coverage options.
